# central_sysops
This is the current version of a web app that I created for myself to interact with and centralize 
data from multiple Systems Administration/Engineering focused services through their various APIs.
This is mostly an application for my own learning. I am interested in programming and data operations,
and this web app gives me both an outlet and a product to use and adjust. If you're interested in this,
please feel free to check it out. No warranty implied.
